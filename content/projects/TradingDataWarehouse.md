Built an end-to-end Financial Trading Data Warehouse solution that demonstrates modern data engineering practices for financial analytics. The system integrates real market data, ETL pipelines, and interactive visualizations in a cloud-based environment.

## Key Components:

- **Data Pipeline**: Automated ETL workflows for real financial market data
- **Data Warehouse**: Well-structured PostgreSQL database on Supabase with star schema design
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive Streamlit app for data exploration and visualization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive GitHub repository with setup and usage instructions

## Technical Implementation:

- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time and batch data collection using Python
- **ETL Processing**: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading workflows
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed on Supabase for scalable data storage
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards with Plotly
- **Reproducibility**: Google Colab notebook for easy replication

This project showcases a production-grade data pipeline architecture that can be extended for real-world financial analytics applications, portfolio management, and algorithmic trading strategies.
