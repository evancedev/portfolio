Designed and implemented a comprehensive domain ontology to solve real-world data integration challenges across multiple data sources. The framework enables seamless semantic integration of data from relational databases, CSV files, and XML documents while preserving meaning and relationships.

## Key Components:

- **Ontology Architecture**: 4 Core Classes (Student, Course, Department, Enrollment)
- **Semantic Relationships**: 3 Object Properties and 15+ Data Properties
- **Entity Resolution**: Consistent URI patterns for cross-source entity alignment
- **Temporal Modeling**: Advanced handling of time-based academic data

## Technical Highlights:

- Designed in Protege 5.x using OWL 2 and RDF
- SPARQL for complex semantic queries
- Extensible architecture for future data sources
- Visual representation of class hierarchies and relationships

This project demonstrates how well-designed ontologies can transform complex data integration challenges into elegant semantic solutions, enabling powerful querying capabilities across heterogeneous data sources.
